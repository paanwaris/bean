## Ecological Motivation

The `bean` package provides a tool to address a fundamental challenge in
species distribution modeling (SDM) and ecological niche modeling (ENM):
**sampling bias**. Occurrence records for species are rarely collected
through a systematic, random process. Instead, they often cluster in
easily accessible areas (like roads and cities) or in well-studied
research sites. This spatial bias can translate into an **environmental
bias**, where the model incorrectly learns that the species is
associated with the environmental conditions of those heavily sampled
areas, rather than its true ecological requirements.

`bean` tackles this problem by thinning occurrence data in
**environmental space**. The goal is to create a more uniform
distribution of points across the species‚Äô observed environmental niche,
reducing the influence of densely clustered records. This allows for the
construction of a more accurate **fundamental niche** volume, which can
then be projected into geographic space to create a less biased
prediction of habitat suitability.

The name `bean` reflects the core principle of the method: ensuring that
each ‚Äúpod‚Äù (a grid cell in environmental space) contains only a
specified number of ‚Äúbeans‚Äù (occurrence points).

## The `bean` Protocol: A Step-by-Step Guide

The recommended workflow is a four-step process designed to be
transparent and reproducible.

### Step 1: Data Preparation and Visualization

Before any analysis, it is crucial to load and inspect the data. This
includes both the species occurrence data and the associated
environmental variables (e.g., from WorldClim). The most critical
pre-processing step is to remove any records with missing environmental
data, as these cannot be used for thinning.

``` r
# Load required libraries
library(bean)
library(dplyr)
#> 
#> Attaching package: 'dplyr'
#> The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
#> 
#>     filter, lag
#> The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
#> 
#>     intersect, setdiff, setequal, union
library(ggplot2)

# Load the raw occurrence data
# This path might need to be adjusted based on your project structure.
occ_data_raw <- read.csv("data/P_maniculatus_samples.csv")

# --- Critical: Clean the data ---
# Remove rows with NA or other non-finite values in the environmental variables.
# The functions in 'bean' have internal checks, but it's best practice to do this explicitly.
occ_data <- occ_data_raw %>%
  filter(is.finite(BIO1) & is.finite(BIO12))

head(occ_data)

### Step 2: Objective Grid Resolution using Pairwise Distances

The most critical parameter in environmental gridding is the
`grid_resolution`. Instead of guessing this value, we can derive it
objectively from the data by analyzing the **distribution of pairwise
environmental distances**.

The logic is to calculate the Euclidean distance between all pairs of
points in the (scaled) environmental space. A small quantile of this
distribution (e.g., the 10th percentile) represents a typical distance
between ‚Äúclose‚Äù points. Using this value as the grid resolution is
statistically justified because it adapts the cell size to the inherent
scale of clustering within the dataset.

The `find_env_resolution()` function automates this process.

``` r
# Set a seed for reproducibility of the resampling in the correlogram
set.seed(81)  

# Let's use the 10th percentile of distances as our resolution
resolution_results <- find_env_resolution(
  data = occ_data,
  env_vars = c("BIO1", "BIO12"),
  quantile = 0.1
)
#> Calculating pairwise environmental distances...
#> Resolution at 0.10 quantile: 0.235417

# The function returns a suggested resolution and the full distance distribution
resolution_results
#> --- Bean Environmental Resolution Analysis (Pairwise Distance) ---
#> 
#> Suggested Grid Resolution: 0.235417
#> (This is the distance at the specified quantile of all pairwise distances)
#> 
#> To see the full distance distribution, run plot(your_results_object).

# We can also plot the distribution to visualize the analysis
# The blue line shows the distance at the chosen quantile.
plot(resolution_results)
```

<img src="man/figures/README-find-resolution-1.png" width="100%" />

``` r

# Let's use this objective resolution in the next step
grid_res <- resolution_results$suggested_resolution
```

### Step 3: Parameter Exploration with `find_optimal_cap()`

This is the most important step for ensuring a defensible thinning
strategy. Instead of guessing parameters, `find_optimal_cap()` allows
you to explore the trade-offs and make a data-driven choice.

**Key Parameters:** \* `grid_resolution`: This defines the size of the
cells in your environmental grid. The choice is ecologically
significant. A small value creates a fine grid, which is sensitive to
small environmental variations but may not thin large, dense clusters
effectively. A large value creates a coarse grid, which is better for
thinning broad-scale bias but may group distinct environmental
conditions together. \* `target_percent`: This is your goal for data
retention. A value of `0.5` means you want to keep approximately 50% of
your data.

The function returns two key recommendations to guide your choice: 1.
`best_cap_closest`: The cap that results in a point count *numerically
closest* to your target. 2. `best_cap_above_target`: The cap that
results in a point count that is *closest to, but not below*, your
target. This is often the safer, more conservative choice if you want to
avoid losing too much data.

``` r
# For reproducibility of the random sampling within the function
set.seed(81) 

# You can manually define the grid resolution based on ecological knowledge
# grid_res <- 0.1 # A resolution of 0.1 unit for the environmental axies

# Let's target retaining 50% of the data
optimal_params <- find_optimal_cap(
  data = occ_data,
  env_vars = c("BIO1", "BIO12"),
  grid_resolution = grid_res,
  target_percent = 0.50
)

# The function automatically saves results to the output directory.
# We can also inspect the returned list object.
# Print the recommendations
optimal_params
#> --- Bean Optimization Results ---
#> 
#> Recommendation for 'Closest to Target':
#>   - Best Cap: 228
#>   - Retained Points: 5006
#> 
#> Recommendation for 'Closest Above Target':
#>   - Best Cap: 228
#>   - Retained Points: 5006
#> 
#> To see the diagnostic plot, run plot(your_results_object).

# Visualize the search process to understand the trade-offs
# The plot is also saved as a PNG in the output directory.
plot(optimal_params)
```

<img src="man/figures/README-find-and-thin-part1-1.png" width="100%" />

``` r
#The plot and the output list show that to get closest to our target of 50%.
```

### Step 4: Apply Thinning with `thin_env_density()`

Based on the exploration in Step 2, you can now make an informed
decision and apply the final thinning. For this protocol, we will
proceed with the `best_cap_above_target` to ensure we meet our minimum
data requirement.

``` r
# --- Choose a cap and apply thinning ---
# This logic ensures that even if one recommendation is NA, the code will not fail.

# Default to a safe value
chosen_cap <- optimal_params$best_cap_above_target
cat(sprintf("Proceeding with cap = %d\n", chosen_cap))
#> Proceeding with cap = 228

# Set a seed again for the final, reproducible thinning
set.seed(81) 

thinned_data <- thin_env_density(
  data = occ_data,
  env_vars = c("BIO1", "BIO12"),
  grid_resolution = grid_res, 
  max_per_cell = chosen_cap
)

cat(sprintf("Original number of points: %d\n", nrow(occ_data)))
#> Original number of points: 10000
cat(sprintf("Thinned number of points:  %d\n", nrow(thinned_data)))
#> Thinned number of points:  5006
cat(sprintf("Percentage of points remaining: %.1f%%\n", 100 * (nrow(thinned_data) / nrow(occ_data))))
#> Percentage of points remaining: 50.1%
```

### 5. Visualize the Thinning Process with Grids

To see exactly what the function is doing, we can draw the environmental
grid over our plots.

``` r
# --- Calculate Grid Line Positions ---
# The grid lines correspond to the 'grid_resolution' parameter.

# For the x-axis (BIO1)
x_range <- range(occ_data$BIO1, na.rm = TRUE)
x_breaks <- seq(
  from = floor(x_range[1] / grid_res) * grid_res,
  to = ceiling(x_range[2] / grid_res) * grid_res,
  by = grid_res
)

# For the y-axis (BIO12)
y_range <- range(occ_data$BIO12, na.rm = TRUE)
y_breaks <- seq(
  from = floor(y_range[1] / grid_res) * grid_res,
  to = ceiling(y_range[2] / grid_res) * grid_res,
  by = grid_res
)

# --- Create a Labeled Data Frame for Comparison ---
# We create a unique ID to robustly identify which points were kept.
occ_data_labeled <- occ_data %>%
  mutate(unique_id = paste(x, y, sep = "_"))

thinned_data_labeled <- thinned_data %>%
  mutate(unique_id = paste(x, y, sep = "_"))
```

Now, let‚Äôs create the plots with the grid overlay.

#### Original Data with Grid

This plot shows the initial clustering of points within the
environmental grid cells.

``` r
ggplot(occ_data, aes(x = BIO1, y = BIO12)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = x_breaks, color = "grey70", linetype = "dashed", linewidth = 0.5) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = y_breaks, color = "grey70", linetype = "dashed", linewidth = 0.5) +
  geom_point(color = "#D55E00", alpha = 0.6, size = 1.5) +
  labs(
    title = "Original Points with Environmental Grid",
    subtitle = paste(nrow(occ_data), "total points"),
    x = "Mean Annual Temperature (BIO1)",
    y = "Annual Precipitation (BIO12)"
  ) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    panel.background = element_blank())
```

<img src="man/figures/README-plot-original-grid-1.png" width="100%" />

#### Thinned Data with Grid

This plot shows the result: a maximum of 228 point(s) per cell.

``` r
ggplot(thinned_data, aes(x = BIO1, y = BIO12)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = x_breaks, color = "grey70", linetype = "dashed", linewidth = 0.5) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = y_breaks, color = "grey70", linetype = "dashed", linewidth = 0.5) +
  geom_point(color = "#0072B2", alpha = 0.6, size = 1.5) +
  labs(
    title = "Thinned Occurrence Points on Environmental Grid",
    subtitle = paste(nrow(thinned_data), "points remaining (max", chosen_cap, "per cell)"),
    x = "Mean Annual Temperature (BIO1)",
    y = "Annual Precipitation (BIO12)"
  ) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    panel.background = element_blank())
```

<img src="man/figures/README-plot-thinned-grid-1.png" width="100%" />

#### Combined Comparison with Grid

``` r
ggplot() +
  # 1. Plot the original data as a background layer
  geom_point(data = occ_data, aes(x = BIO1, y = BIO12), 
             color = "#D55E00", alpha = 0.6, size = 2) +
  
  # 2. Add the grid lines
  geom_vline(xintercept = x_breaks, color = "grey70", linetype = "dashed", linewidth = 0.5) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = y_breaks, color = "grey70", linetype = "dashed", linewidth = 0.5) +
  
  # 3. Plot the thinned data on top in a prominent color
  geom_point(data = thinned_data, aes(x = BIO1, y = BIO12), 
             color = "#0072B2", alpha = 0.7, size = 1) +
  
  # 4. Add informative labels
  labs(
    title = "Thinned Points Overlaid on Original Data",
    subtitle = paste(nrow(thinned_data), "points remaining (blue) from", nrow(occ_data), "original points (orange)"),
    x = "Mean Annual Temperature (BIO1)",
    y = "Annual Precipitation (BIO12)"
  ) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    panel.background = element_blank())
```

<img src="man/figures/README-plot-combined-comparison-grid-1.png" width="100%" />

### Step 6: Delineate and Visualize the Niche Ellipse

The final step is to take the cleaned, thinned occurrence points and
formalize the environmental niche by fitting a bivariate ellipse. The
`fit_ellipsoid()` function delineates this niche boundary.

``` r
# Fit an ellipse that contains 95% of the thinned data
niche_ellipse <- fit_ellipsoid(
  data = thinned_data,
  env_vars = c("BIO1", "BIO12"),
  level = 0.95
)

# The returned object contains all the details
# We can use the custom print() method for a clean summary
niche_ellipse
#> --- Bean Environmental Niche Ellipse ---
#> 
#> Fitted to 5006 data points at a 95.00% confidence level.
#> 4990 out of 5006 points (99.7%) fall within the ellipse boundary.
#> 
#> Niche Center (Mean Vector):
#>       BIO1      BIO12 
#> -0.4296510 -0.3196515

# And we can use the custom plot() method for a powerful visualization
plot(niche_ellipse)
```

<img src="man/figures/README-fit-ellipse-1.png" width="100%" />

This complete workflow demonstrates how `bean` can be used to make a
data-driven, transparent, and reproducible choice about thinning
parameters, strengthening the scientific validity of subsequent modeling
efforts.
