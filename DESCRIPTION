Title: Data Thinning of Species Occurrences in Environmental Space

Description: Provides tools to address sampling bias in species occurrence records by thinning data in environmental space (E-space), a crucial pre-processing step for ecological niche modeling (ENM). The package offers a data-driven protocol to objectively determine thinning parameters, provides both stochastic and deterministic thinning methods, and includes functions to delineate the resulting environmental niche using robust ellipses. The name 'bean' reflects the core principle of the method: ensuring that each “pod” (a grid cell in E-space) contains only a specified number of “beans” (occurrence points).
