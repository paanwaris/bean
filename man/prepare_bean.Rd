\title{Prepare data for environmental thinning}
\usage{
prepare_bean(data, env_rasters, longitude, latitude, transform = "scale")
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data.frame of species occurrences records, including columns
for longitude and latitude.}

\item{env_rasters}{A SpatRaster (from \code{terra} package) or RasterStack (from \code{raster} package)
object of environmental variables.}

\item{longitude}{(character) The name of the longitude column in \code{data}.}

\item{latitude}{(character) The name of the latitude column in \code{data}.}

\item{transform}{(character) The transformation to apply to the environmental
rasters before extracting data. Options are "scale" (default), "pca",
or "none". See Details.}
}
\value{
A data.frame containing the cleaned and scaled occurrence data, with
  the following columns:
  \item{Original Columns}{All columns from the input \code{data} are preserved for the valid records.}
  \item{Environmental Variables}{New columns, named after the layers in \code{env_rasters}, containing the extracted and scaled environmental data.}
}
\description{
This function serves as a pre-processing step to clean and prepare species
occurrence data. It performs three key actions:
1. Removes records with missing longitude or latitude values.
2. Extracts environmental data from raster layers that are already scaled
   for each occurrence point.
3. Removes records that fall outside the raster extent or have missing
   environmental data.
The final output is a clean data frame where the environmental variables
have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

### Environmental Variable Transformation

The \code{transform} argument allows for different pre-processing of the
environmental raster layers to address issues like differing units and
multicollinearity.

- "scale" (Default):** This is the standard approach to handle variables
  with different units (e.g., °C vs. mm). It transforms each raster layer to
  have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 (Baddeley et al., 2016). This process makes
  the variables equal variance. As a result,
  each variable contributes equally to the analysis, ensuring that the
  resulting resolutions are based on the relative distribution of data points
  within each environmental dimension, not their arbitrary original units
  (Beaugrand, 2024; Kléparski et al., 2021).

- "pca": This option performs a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on
  the environmental rasters. This is a powerful technique for dealing with
  multicollinearity (highly correlated variables). It transforms the original
  rasters into a new set of uncorrelated layers (Principal Components) (Qiao et al., 2016). The
  function then extracts the PC scores for each occurrence point.

- "none": This option extracts the raw environmental values from the
  rasters without any transformation. This is suitable if your rasters are
  already scaled or if you have a specific reason to use the raw values.
