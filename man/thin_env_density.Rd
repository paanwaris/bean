\title{Thin occurrence data based on environmental density}
\usage{
thin_env_density(data, env_vars, grid_resolution, max_per_cell, seed = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing species occurrences and environmental data.}

\item{env_vars}{A character vector of length two specifying the names of the
columns to be used as the axes of the environmental space (e.g.,
c("temp_mean", "salinity_mean")).}

\item{grid_resolution}{A single numeric value specifying the resolution of the
grid to be applied to the environmental space.}

\item{max_per_cell}{An integer specifying the maximum number of points to
retain per grid cell.}

\item{seed}{An optional integer to set the random seed for reproducibility
of the sampling step.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the thinned set of occurrence points.
}
\description{
This function thins species occurrence records in a 2D environmental space
defined by two user-specified variables. It applies a grid to this space
and samples points from cells that exceed a given density cap.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
  # Assume 'my_occ_data' is a data frame with temp_mean and salinity_mean columns
  thinned_data <- thin_env_density(
    data = my_occ_data,
    env_vars = c("temp_mean", "salinity_mean"),
    grid_resolution = 0.1,
    max_per_cell = 1,
    seed = 123
  )

  # Compare number of points
  nrow(my_occ_data)
  nrow(thinned_data)
}
