\title{Visualize environmental thinning results}
\usage{
plot_bean(original_data, thinned_object, env_vars, grid_resolution)
}
\arguments{
\item{original_data}{A data.frame containing species occurrences and pre-scaled
environmental variables, typically the output of \code{\link{prepare_bean}}.}

\item{thinned_object}{The output object from either \code{\link{thin_env_density}} or
\code{\link{thin_env_center}}. The function will automatically detect the thinning type.}

\item{env_vars}{A character vector of length two specifying the names of the
environmental variables to plot on the x and y axes.}

\item{grid_resolution}{A numeric vector of length two specifying the grid
resolution used for thinning. This is required to draw the grid correctly.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object.
}
\description{
This function creates a comparison plot showing the original,
unthinned occurrence points overlaid with the results of an environmental
thinning process. It draws the environmental grid to visualize how points
were either sampled (stochastic) or consolidated to cell centers (deterministic).
