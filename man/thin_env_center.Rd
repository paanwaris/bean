\title{Deterministic centroid}
\usage{
thin_env_center(data, env_vars, grid_resolution)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data.frame containing species occurrence coordinates and the environmental variables.}

\item{env_vars}{A character vector specifying the column names in data that represent the environmental variables to be used in the analysis.}

\item{grid_resolution}{A numeric vector of length one or two specifying the
resolution(s) for the grid axes. If length one, it is used for both axes. See the Details section of \code{\link{find_env_resolution}} for a full explanation}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{bean_thinned_center}. which is a list containing:
  \item{thinned_points}{A data.frame with two columns representing the new
    points at the center of each occupied environmental grid cell.}
  \item{n_original}{An integer representing the number of complete occurrence
    records in the input data.}
  \item{n_thinned}{An integer representing the number of unique grid cells
    that were occupied, which is also the number of points returned.}
  \item{parameters}{A list of the key parameters used, such as whether
    scaling was applied.}
}
\description{
This function thins species occurrence records by finding all
occupied cells in a 2D environmental grid and returning a single new point
at the exact center of each of those cells. This is a deterministic method.

# 1. Create environmental data
set.seed(81)
env_data <- data.frame(
BIO1 = c(0.1, 0.2, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3),
BIO12 = c(0.1, 0.2, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3)

# 2. Thin the data to grid cell centers
thinned_center_obj <- thin_env_center(
  data = env_data,
  env_vars = c("BIO1", "BIO12"),
  grid_resolution = c(0.1, 0.2)

# 3. Print the summary
