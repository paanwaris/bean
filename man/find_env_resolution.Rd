\title{Find objective grid resolutions for each environmental axis}
\usage{
find_env_resolution(data, env_vars, quantile = 0.1, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing species occurrences and pre-scaled
environmental data.}

\item{env_vars}{A character vector of length two specifying the names of the
environmental variables to use.}

\item{quantile}{(numeric) The quantile of pairwise distances to use for the
resolution. A smaller value (e.g., 0.05 or 0.1) is recommended.
Default = 0.1.}

\item{verbose}{(logical) If TRUE, prints progress messages and warnings.
Default = TRUE.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{bean_resolution}.
}
\description{
This function assumes the environmental variables in the input
data have already been scaled (e.g., using `scale()`). It calculates the
distribution of all pairwise 1D distances for each variable. The distance
at a specified lower quantile is returned as a suggested grid resolution
for each axis.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# 1. Load the example occurrence data included with the package
occ_file <- system.file("extdata", "P_maniculatus_samples.csv", package = "bean")
occ_data <- read.csv(occ_file)
# 2. Find the resolution at the 10th percentile
resolutions <- find_env_resolution(
  data = occ_data,
  env_vars = c("BIO1", "BIO12"),
  quantile = 0.1
)

# 3. Print the summary and plot the results
print(resolutions)
plot(resolutions)

# 4. Extract the suggested resolution
grid_res <- resolution_results$suggested_resolution
}
