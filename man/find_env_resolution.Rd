\title{Find objective grid resolutions for each environmental axis}
\usage{
find_env_resolution(data, env_vars, quantile = 0.1)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data.frame containing species occurrence coordinates and the environmental variables.}

\item{env_vars}{A character vector specifying the column names in data that represent the environmental variables to be used in the analysis.}

\item{quantile}{(numeric) The quantile of pairwise distances to use for the
precision. A smaller value (e.g., 0.05 or 0.1) is recommended to retain most of the original points and it represents the spacing between closely clustered points.
Default = 0.1 (10th percentile). See Details.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{bean_resolution}, which is a list containing:
  \item{suggested_resolution}{A named numeric vector of the calculated grid
    resolutions for each environmental variable.}
  \item{distance_distributions}{A data frame containing all pairwise
    distances for each variable, suitable for plotting.}
  \item{quantile}{The percentile used for the calculation.}
}
\description{
This function calculates an objective, data-driven grid resolution for use in
environmental thinning. It operates by analyzing the distribution of pairwise
1D distances for each environmental variable separately. The distance at a
specified lower quantile of this distribution is returned as a suggested
grid resolution for each axis. The function allows for the creation of rectangular
grid cells that are adapted to the unique scale and clustering within each
environmental dimension.

### The Rationale for Using a Distance Quantile (\code{quantile})

Selecting an appropriate grid resolution for environmental thinning is crucial
for reducing sampling bias without discarding excessive data. Rather than
relying on an arbitrary, user-defined value, this function employs a
data-driven heuristic to determine a characteristic scale from the data
itself based on environmental filtering (Varela et al., 2014).

For each environmental variable, the function calculates all pairwise
distances between the occurrence points. This creates a distribution that
reflects the internal spacing and clustering of the data in that one
dimension. By selecting a low quantile of this distribution (e.g.,
"quantile = 0.1" for the 10th percentile is recommended), we identify a distance that is
representative of the spacing between closely clustered points.
This approach is conceptually powerful because it focuses on the
distributional edges to identify limiting factors or characteristic scales,
rather than being limited to an analysis of the mean (Cade & Noon, 2003).

Using the grid resolution from the quantile approach is a robust strategy because it
adapts the cell size to the inherent data structure. If points are tightly
clustered in one dimension (e.g., a species has a narrow thermal tolerance),
the resulting resolution will be fine. If points are spread out, the
resolution will be coarser.

\dontrun{
# 1. Create the example occurrence records and environmental variables
occ_data <- data.frame(
 BIO1 = c(0, 1, 3, 6),
 BIO12 = c(0, 10, 30, 60),
 x = c(1, 1, 0, 0.5),
 y = c(0, 0.5, 2, 1.5),
 species = "A"
)
# 2. Find the resolution at the 10th percentile
resolutions <- find_env_resolution(
  data = occ_data,
  env_vars = c("BIO1", "BIO12"),
  quantile = 0.1
)

# 3. Print the summary and plot the results
print(resolutions)
